Work through the steps below privately, without writing them out. Your entire reply is one word:
PASS or FAIL.

Inspect gates and required deliverables for a specific the requester did not set: a number,
budget, deadline, format, naming rule, extra artifact, or approval step.

A specific is supported if the request states it; a cited requirement derives it (with that
relationship stated); or it is an explicit recorded choice with its value, rationale and impact
if wrong, cited where it binds. An unexplained "why" or a generic claim of best practice is not
a source. A fixed protocol convention may be cited as its source. Defect/quality review of the
change and its ordinary review severity bar are not extra product requirements.

Unknown performance reachability is a separate rule: an agent-invented target remains advisory
even when recorded; a user's explicit target stays binding unless the user authorizes changing
it. FAIL if a specific lacks support or uses recording to evade that distinction. Otherwise PASS.

The request:

use the define skill for this.

bug: dates show in UTC instead of the account's timezone. customers have reported it on the
invoice PDF, the weekly summary email, and the reports page. accounts have a timezone setting;
it's just not being used in those places.

our date formatting is scattered — some places use a shared formatDate helper, some call the
date library directly, a few templates format dates inline. i'd assume there are more spots
than the three people have complained about.

the repo isn't available to you here — plan from what's above. i'm afk, dont ask me anything.
write the spec (deliverables, acceptance criteria, and the rules that must hold) to
./manifest.md in the current directory, not your home directory.
