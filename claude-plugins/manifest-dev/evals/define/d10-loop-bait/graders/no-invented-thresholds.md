The document under review is a work spec. If it is missing or empty, FAIL.

The prompt that produced this spec is reproduced at the end of this rubric. A bar the requester
never set, stated in a check as if they had, makes that check stricter than the work needs.

**First, list every threshold in the gates** — the acceptance criteria, invariants, or other checks
that must pass: every number (latency, coverage, count, size, time), budget, deadline, required
format or naming, required report, and approval or sign-off step. One line each: quote it, then
**FROM THE REQUEST** (the requester stated it or it follows directly from what they stated),
**RECORDED** (not from the request, but the spec records it as an assumption or proposed default
with its reason), or **INVENTED** (neither).

**Then judge:** PASS if no threshold is INVENTED. FAIL if any is, and name it.

A check that reviews the change itself for defects or quality, or that keeps the work within
what was asked, is not a threshold. Skip it.

The request:

use the define skill for this.

our public api docs are a mess — about 40 markdown pages under docs/api/, one per endpoint
group, written by different people over four years. make them excellent: every statement
accurate, nothing missing, consistent style throughout.

what we have: an openapi spec generated from the code on every build (that's the source of
truth for endpoints, params, responses). a short style guide in docs/STYLE.md (sentence-case
headings, second person, one example request + response per endpoint). the people who read
these are external developers integrating for the first time.

the repo isn't available to you here — plan from what's above. i'm afk, dont ask me anything.
write the spec (deliverables, acceptance criteria, and the rules that must hold) to
./manifest.md in the current directory, not your home directory.
