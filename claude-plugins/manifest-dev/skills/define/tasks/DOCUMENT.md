# DOCUMENT Task Guidance

Specs, proposals, reports, formal documentation. Composes with WRITING.md (base for all prose).

## Quality Gates

| Aspect | Agent | Threshold |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Structure completeness | general-purpose | All required sections present |
| Consistency | general-purpose | Terminology and style uniform throughout |

## Risks

- **Missing sections** - template or standard not followed; probe: is there a required structure?
- **Stale on arrival** - content outdated by time of publication
- **No review gate** - published without stakeholder sign-off; probe: who must approve?

## Scenario Prompts

- **Stale on arrival** - accurate when written, outdated by publication; probe: how fast does this domain change?
- **Missing stakeholder concern** - answers wrong questions; probe: what will stakeholders look for?
- **Contradicts other docs** - conflicts with existing documentation; probe: related docs that need alignment?
- **No clear next steps** - reader finishes, doesn't know what to do; probe: what action follows reading?
- **Terminology mismatch** - uses terms differently than codebase/team; probe: glossary needed? terms defined?
- **Approval ambiguity** - unclear who signs off; probe: approval process? required reviewers?
- **Maintenance orphan** - no owner to update when things change; probe: who maintains this?
- **Format mismatch** - wrong format for consumption context; probe: where is this read? how?
- **Scope ambiguity** - unclear what's covered vs not; probe: explicit scope boundaries?

## Trade-offs

- Comprehensive vs readable
- Formal vs accessible
- Detail vs brevity
