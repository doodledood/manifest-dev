# DOCUMENT Task Guidance

Specs, proposals, reports, formal documentation.

## Quality Gates

| Aspect | Agent | Threshold |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Structure completeness | general-purpose | All required sections present |
| Audience fit | general-purpose | Language and depth match target reader |
| Clarity | general-purpose | No ambiguous terms or undefined jargon |
| Consistency | general-purpose | Terminology and style uniform throughout |
| Accuracy | general-purpose | Claims supported, no contradictions |

## Risks

- **Wrong audience** - too technical or too shallow for readers; probe: who reads this, what do they know?
- **Missing sections** - template or standard not followed; probe: is there a required structure?
- **Stale on arrival** - content outdated by time of publication
- **No review gate** - published without stakeholder sign-off; probe: who must approve?

## Scenario Prompts

Consider these failure scenarios when probing:

- **Stale on arrival** - document accurate when written but outdated by publication; probe: how fast does this domain change?
- **Wrong assumptions about reader** - too much or too little context given; probe: what does the reader already know?
- **Missing stakeholder concern** - document answers the wrong questions; probe: what will stakeholders look for?

## Trade-offs

- Comprehensive vs readable
- Formal vs accessible
- Detail vs brevity
