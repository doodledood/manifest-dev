# Amendment Mode

/define modifies an existing manifest instead of building from scratch.

## Core Behavior

Read the manifest at the given path. Existing decisions (ACs, INVs, PGs, Approach, Trade-offs) are preserved unless directly contradicted by the change request. Make targeted changes — only items affected by the amendment are updated. Add new items, modify contradicted items, or remove items that no longer apply.

**Coverage goals apply scoped to the change** — not the full manifest. Existing manifest content satisfies goals for unchanged areas.

## What Triggers Amendment

The conversation context contains the reason — a user's message, a PR review comment, or an explicit change request. Read this context and determine what to change.

## Interview Style

When `--interview` is explicitly provided, use it. Otherwise, inherit the interview style from the manifest's metadata (if recorded) or default to `thorough`. The amendment interview is scoped to the change — not a full re-interview of the entire manifest.

## Three Contexts

### 1. Standalone

User calls `/define --amend <manifest>` directly. Full interactive mode:
- Interview the user about the change
- Run verification loop per mode
- Present summary for approval
- Same as normal /define but starting from existing manifest

### 2. From /do (Autonomous Fast Path)

Triggered by `--from-do` flag (e.g., `/define --amend <manifest> --from-do`). This flag is set by /do after Self-Amendment escalation — it signals deterministically that this is an autonomous amendment, not an interactive session.

In /do context, amendment is autonomous and fast — no user approval gates (verification loop, summary approval). Make targeted changes based on the escalation context. Write updated manifest in-place so /do can resume immediately. Log the amendment in the manifest's `## Amendments` section.

### 3. Session-Default

Triggered implicitly by `/define`'s in-session detection of a prior related manifest (no explicit `--amend` flag). See SKILL.md's `## Session-Default Amendment` section for the detection and relatedness rules. Once the agent decides to amend, behavior **follows the Standalone path** — interview scoped to the change (per the active interview mode), verification loop, summary for approval. The interview mode (`thorough` / `minimal` / `autonomous`) is **not** overridden by the trigger context — `/auto` invocations still run autonomously, just amending the prior manifest instead of starting fresh. The user is told upfront via an announcement and can verbally redirect to a fresh manifest if the relatedness call was wrong.

## What to Preserve

Intent, Approach architecture (unless contradicted), existing ACs/INVs that aren't affected, Process Guidance, Known Assumptions. Execution order may need updating if new deliverables are added.

## What to Change

Add/modify/remove ACs, add new deliverables, update INVs, adjust trade-offs. Use amendment IDs per the manifest's Amendment Protocol (e.g., `INV-G1.1 amends INV-G1`). Always log changes in `## Amendments` with what changed and why.
