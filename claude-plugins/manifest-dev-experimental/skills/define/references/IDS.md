| Type | Format | Example | Consumer |
|------|--------|---------|----------|
| Global Invariant | INV-G{N} | INV-G1, INV-G2 | /verify (verified) |
| Process Guidance | PG-{N} | PG-1, PG-2 | /do (followed) |
| Risk Area | R-{N} | R-1, R-2 | /do (watched) |
| Trade-off | T-{N} | T-1, T-2 | /do (consulted) |
| Known Assumption | ASM-{N} | ASM-1, ASM-2 | /verify (audited) |
| Acceptance Criteria | AC-{D}.{N} | AC-1.1, AC-2.3 | /verify (verified) |

`{D}` = deliverable number. `{N}` = ordinal within scope (1-based).

PG-* items guide HOW to work — followed during /do, not checked by /verify.
