# X/Twitter Post: Manifest-Driven Development

---

## Main Post

Stop asking "how do I get the AI to code this properly?"

Start asking "what would make me accept this PR?"

Packaged this as a Claude Code plugin.

/define → surfaces what you actually care about
/do → AI implements with flexibility
/verify → automated checks until done

## Notes

**Format rationale**: Research shows single posts with GIFs get highest engagement (6.5 median interactions). Threads only surface first tweet algorithmically. Links suppress reach—moved to reply.

**GIF content**: Terminal recording of /define interview. Show Claude asking probing questions, user answering, manifest being built. Keep under 15 seconds.

**Posting strategy**:
- Post main tweet with GIF
- Immediately reply with link tweet
- This preserves engagement while providing the CTA

**Alternative hooks to test**:
- "AI agents keep missing the obvious. The fix isn't better prompts—it's better acceptance criteria."
- "Define what done looks like. Let the AI figure out how. Verify it hit the bar. Repeat."
