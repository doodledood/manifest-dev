# X/Twitter Post: Manifest-Driven Development

---

## Main Post

Stop asking "how do I get the AI to code this properly?"

Start asking "what would make me accept this PR?"

That one question changes everything.

Packaged this as a Claude Code plugin.

/define → AI interviews you, surfaces what you'd actually reject a PR for
/do → AI implements, verifies, fixes failures—until done

Two commands. The rest is automated.
No handholding or babysitting.

## Notes

**Format rationale**: Research shows single posts with GIFs get highest engagement (6.5 median interactions). Threads only surface first tweet algorithmically. Links suppress reach—moved to reply.

**GIF content**: Terminal recording of /define interview. Show Claude asking probing questions, user answering, manifest being built. Keep under 15 seconds.

**Posting strategy**:
- Post main tweet with GIF
- Immediately reply with link tweet
- This preserves engagement while providing the CTA

**Alternative hooks to test**:
- "AI agents keep missing the obvious. The fix isn't better prompts—it's better acceptance criteria."
- "The question isn't how to prompt the AI. It's what would make you accept the output."
