# Launch Schedule: manifest-dev

## Overview

Blog is the anchor. Everything else references it. Publish blog first, then cascade social posts over 2-3 days to maintain momentum without overwhelming any single platform.

---

## Day 0 (Preparation)

**Before launch:**
- [ ] Record GIF of `/define` in terminal (for Twitter visual)
- [ ] Verify blog is live at aviramk.com/blog
- [ ] Prep all posts in draft mode on each platform

---

## Day 1 (Tuesday or Wednesday)

### Morning (8:00 AM EST)
**Blog Post**
- Publish blog at aviramk.com
- Why: Sets the anchor. All other content links here. Tuesday/Wednesday avoids Monday chaos and Friday dropoff.

### Mid-Morning (9:30 AM EST)
**X/Twitter Thread**
- Post the 5-7 tweet thread
- Why: Research shows Tue-Thu 9-11 AM EST is optimal for dev Twitter engagement. Gives blog a couple hours to be indexed before driving traffic.

### Early Afternoon (2:00 PM EST)
**LinkedIn Post**
- Publish post with link in first comment
- Why: 2-3 PM EST is a secondary peak for LinkedIn (after 8-9 AM). Staggers from Twitter to avoid self-competition and reaches people during afternoon break.

---

## Day 2 (Wednesday or Thursday)

### Mid-Morning (10:00 AM EST)
**Reddit: r/ClaudeAI**
- Post to r/ClaudeAI
- Why: Day 2 gives blog time to accumulate some social proof (shares, stars). Reddit communities are skeptical of Day 1 posts—a bit of traction helps credibility.

### Afternoon (2:00 PM EST)
**Reddit: r/vibecoding**
- Post custom version to r/vibecoding
- Why: Different timezone coverage than morning post. Also tests which framing resonates better before cross-pollination.

---

## Day 1 or 2 (Flexible)

**Slack: Claude Code Devs Channel**
- Post when team is active (check Slack activity patterns)
- Why: Internal message timing is less critical than public platforms. Post during active hours for your team.

**Slack: Broader Engineering Channel**
- Post 1-2 hours after Claude Code devs message
- Why: If Claude Code devs have questions/reactions, you can address them before the broader share.

## Summary Table

| Platform | Day | Time (EST) | Rationale |
|----------|-----|------------|-----------|
| Blog | Day 1 | 8:00 AM | Anchor content, needs to be live first |
| X/Twitter | Day 1 | 9:30 AM | Optimal engagement window (9-11 AM Tue-Thu) |
| LinkedIn | Day 1 | 2:00 PM | Secondary peak, staggers from Twitter |
| r/ClaudeAI | Day 2 | 10:00 AM | Let blog build traction first |
| r/vibecoding | Day 2 | 2:00 PM | Different timezone, test framing |
| Slack (Claude Code) | Day 1-2 | Team active hours | Internal, flexible |
| Slack (Engineering) | Day 1-2 | 1-2 hours after above | Buffer for internal Q&A |

## Notes

- **Day 1 should be Tuesday or Wednesday** — avoids Monday (everyone catching up) and Thursday/Friday (weekend wind-down)
- **Engage for 60-90 minutes** after each social post — algorithm rewards early engagement, especially on LinkedIn
- **Monitor r/ClaudeAI before posting** — if there's a hot post about AI coding problems, ride that timing
- **Don't post all Reddits same day** — looks like coordinated spam, reduces organic feel
