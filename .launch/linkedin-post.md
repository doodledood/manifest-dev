# LinkedIn Post: Manifest-Driven Development

## Post Body

Here's what weeks of shipping with AI coding agents taught me:

We're asking the wrong question.

Instead of "how do I get the AI to code this properly?"

Ask: "What would make me accept this PR in full?"

That reframe changes everything.

When you define acceptance criteria—not implementation steps—the AI has flexibility to adapt. When you verify against those criteria automatically, you catch issues before you see them.

I call this manifest-driven development:

→ Define: LLM interviews you, surfaces latent criteria
→ Do: AI implements toward the criteria
→ Verify: Automated checks run against every AC
→ Fix: What fails gets fixed. What passes is locked in.

After weeks of production use, this is the most reliable way I've found to ship quality code with AI.

Not because it removes limitations—but because it works with them.

I wrote up the full approach with a worked example.
